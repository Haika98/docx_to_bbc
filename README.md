# docx-to-fa
A tool used to translate a docx file to a txt with formatting for Fur Affinity. This can be helpful for posting stories in the description without having to lose formatting.

Run with: `python3 docxtofa.py [options] "FILE.docx"`

Note: Requires python3 and python-docx

Use `pip install python-docx`

*****

Note:

This tool cannot currently parse headings, hyperlinks, or horizontal lines. You'll have to insert five or more dashes (-----) manually where you'd like them to go.

Also note that Fur Affinity unfortunately does not support indenting. This program will output them fine to the text file, but they won't mean anything when actually used on the site.
